  Scenario Outline: Check visibility of 'oe_announcement'
    When I am on "/en/rdf_entity/<path>"
    
    # Then I should see "<title>" in the "breadcrumb" region
    And I should see the heading "<title>" in the "page header" region

    Examples:
    | path                                                                                                                 | title                                                                             |
