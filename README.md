### Using Docker Compose

Alternatively you can build a test site using Docker and Docker-compose with the provided configuration.

Requirements:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-docker)
- [Docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

Copy `docker-compose.yml.dist` into `docker-compose.yml`.

You can make any alterations you need for your local Docker setup. However, the defaults should be enough to set the project up.

Run:

```
$ docker-compose up -d
```
